# Spectral-clustering-for-Controlled-Islaning
In this code, spectral clustering is presented for the purpose of controlled islanding of the system in different operating conditions. 
This plan has the ability to recognize and separate important and non-important disturbances and prevents unintentional islanding and has high efficiency.
